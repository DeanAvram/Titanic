# Titanic
My solution to the Titanic ML competition in Kaggle

The Titanic competition is a famous challenge in Kaggle where the mission is to use machine learning to predict who will and will not survive the titanic based on several details about each passenger.
In my notebook, I first explore the data - types of features, amount of missing values, relations between features, etc.
Then, I built a few models. To find out what are the best hyper-parameters for each model I draw many graphs with matplotlib and seaborn.
Finally, I used common KPIs to measure my results.
