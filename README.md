# Titanic
My solution to the Titanic ML competition in Kaggle

The Titanic competition is a famous challenge in Kaggle where the mission is to use machine learning to predict who will and will not survive the titanic based on several details about each passenger.
# EDA
In the EDA phase, I explore the data - types of features, amount of missing values, relations between features, etc.

# Data pre-processing
In the pre-processing phase, I performed manipulation of the data based on what I found in the EDA phase. I dropped columns with a big amount of missing values or columns with unimportant data. In addition, I sacle my numercial features and encode my categorial features.

# Predictions 
Then, I built a few models. To find out what are the best hyper-parameters for each model I draw many graphs with matplotlib and seaborn.
Finally, I used common KPIs to measure my results.
